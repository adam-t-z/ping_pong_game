# Ping Pong Game ðŸŽ®

A classic two-player Ping Pong game built with Python's `turtle` module. Players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth, aiming to score points by making the opponent miss.

## Features
- Smooth animations using Python's `turtle` graphics.
- Real-time collision detection with walls and paddles.
- Scoring system to keep track of points for both players.
- Progressive difficulty as the ball speeds up with each paddle hit.

## Gameplay Instructions
- **Player 1 (Right Paddle)**:  
  - Move Up: Press the **Up Arrow** key.  
  - Move Down: Press the **Down Arrow** key.  
- **Player 2 (Left Paddle)**:  
  - Move Up: Press the **W** key.  
  - Move Down: Press the **S** key.  

The game starts with the ball moving automatically. Hit the ball with your paddle to bounce it back. A point is scored when the opponent misses the ball.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Turtle graphics module (pre-installed with Python).

## How to Run
